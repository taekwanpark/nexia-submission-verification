# Submission Proof

App key: `submission-proof`. Composer package: `nexia/submission-proof`.
PHP namespace: `Nexia\Apps\Nexia\SubmissionProof`; PSR-4 source: `src/`.

Read AGENTS.md and the design records in docs/. Install the public dependencies
with Composer and npm in this App directory. The platform operator provides
the Nexia Sandbox; this repository contains no Core installation.

## Connect and run

Create a project and prepare its sandbox at https://developers.nexia.to.
From this App directory, use the public CLI:

```sh
nexia login <project-id>
nexia link
nexia make:resource Note --label-ko '메모'
nexia app register
composer install --no-scripts
npm install
nexia dev
```

Login opens a browser on a local interactive terminal; otherwise open its printed
URL to approve the project connection. Keep dev running and open its workspace
URL. Open Notes in a work tab, save a record, and reopen it to confirm persistence.
`nexia dev` builds and watches React screens through the installed Vite tool.
Use `nexia make:page ExamplePage --label-ko '예시'` for a page without a resource.

`link` chooses the project, `app register` registers identity, and `dev` runs this
App. Registration does not publish or install it. Use a separate dev terminal and
port for each App; `nexia apps list` lists the project's registered Apps.
After preparation, open **Development → Project Apps → Test permissions** in the console. Grant Note read, create and update permissions. Select a legal entity only when the App declares legal-entity-scoped permissions. Grants are explicit and expire with the sandbox. Refresh an already open App tab.

Review generated fields, permissions, migrations and translations before
submitting an immutable version for review.

For a local or separately operated platform only, set
`nexia config endpoint <URL>` before login. This clears the previous connection.

## Docker tools

Use the generated Dockerfile and Compose service when PHP/Node are not installed
on the host. On macOS/Linux set `NEXIA_UID` and `NEXIA_GID` to `id -u` and `id -g`
so generated files belong to you. On Windows omit those variables.

```sh
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm dev login <project-id>
docker compose run --rm dev link
docker compose run --rm dev app register
docker compose run --rm dev make:resource ExampleResource --label-ko 예시
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint npm dev install
docker compose up
```

For an alternate platform, run `docker compose run --rm dev config endpoint <URL>`
before Docker login; the host CLI connection is separate. After preparation,
grant the generated resource test permissions in the console, open the workspace
URL, and save/reopen a record.

The image contains public CLI/SDK/devtools only. The App is mounted at runtime;
its files and secrets are excluded from the image build context. Docker login
uses a private per-user directory in the named volume. Do not copy credentials
from the host or remove the login volume merely to restart a command.


## Checks

```sh
nexia validate
composer install --no-scripts
composer test
```

`nexia validate` parses source without running App code. The generated resource
test checks its authorization declaration; add App-owned behavior tests for
real data and permissions. Composer tests execute your App test code. Do not
point local tests at a tenant database. Core's test classes are not dependencies.
Frontend tests use `npm test` after installing dependencies; add actual test
files before using that result as evidence.

`nexia dev` builds and watches the App's React entry in `dist/frontend/`, including
lazy surface chunks and a Vite manifest. SDK/React peers remain external for the
Nexia host; this output is not a standalone HTML preview. The build does not load
`.env` files or copy `public/`. Import browser assets explicitly from frontend
source. Never import secrets or PHP files. Building executes your Vite config
and dependencies; it is separate from the non-executing `nexia validate` check.

With Docker, install in the same mounted App directory using
`docker compose run --rm --entrypoint npm dev install`. Keep the generated
package lock in your repository. Local builds require Node.js 22.12 or later and npm 11.6.2 (11.x).
Without changing your global npm installation, run
`npm exec --yes --package=npm@11.6.2 -- npm install` to create the lock.
The generated Docker image already includes this npm version.

Resource generation creates the PHP/React application screens by default. Add `--with-filament` only when you also need Filament administration screens. Omitting that option, including during `--force` regeneration, preserves existing administration files and their manifest registration.

## Note lifecycle and API contract

Notes are tenant-owned acceptance records. Create requires a nonempty name up to
255 characters. Update is a partial update: omitting `name` intentionally leaves
it unchanged and returns the current record. This permits an empty update body;
it does not change ownership or bypass the update permission check.

Deletion requires the explicit `submission-proof.note.delete` permission and a
matching tenant record. It is a soft delete: the record disappears from ordinary
list/detail/update routes, while its audit/history remains retained. This initial
App has no end-user restore or purge operation. Deleted records remain retained
until the test tenant is retired by its platform operator; a future retention or
restore feature requires its own reviewed permissions and implementation. No
background purge or destructive migration is included in this release.

The App policy tests exercise exact permission denial/grant and record mismatch.
The platform build separately checks migration, protocol and denied-write behavior.
Live acceptance validates authorized create/update/read/delete and isolation on the
Developers host; the unit suite is not claimed to replace that request-level check.
