# Submission Proof Domain Model

> Design status: Not started. This document is the split-out home for the design
> record's logical-model section. Record every logical model this App needs to
> operate, not only models named by one current process.
>
> Keep the model order below unchanged. It is the canonical classification order
> defined by the App model inventory contract (master and definition → policy and
> configuration → operational → Core and cross-App references). Do not merge,
> reorder, or rename these classes; add `### ModelName` blocks under the class a
> model belongs to.

## 1. Aggregate boundaries

| Aggregate root | Owned logical children | Consistency boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |

## 2. Master and definition models

Reusable business subjects, catalogs, classifications, codes, and versioned
definitions.

<!-- One `### ModelName` block per model: identity, ownership, and rules. -->

## 3. Policy and configuration models

Calculation, approval, allowance, default, calendar, template, mapping,
numbering, and effectivity rules.

<!-- One `### ModelName` block per model. -->

## 4. Operational models

Business cases, execution, results, histories, ledgers, balances, and
state-changing records.

<!-- One `### ModelName` block per model, each stating its lifecycle. -->

## 5. Core and cross-App references

Cross-App persistence is forbidden. Other-App references use Core
ResourceReference, events, imported values, external identifiers, or frozen
snapshots.

| Workbook reference | Mode | Required behavior | Missing-App fallback | Frozen display evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 6. Invariants

<!-- Numbered business invariants this App guarantees. -->

## Workbook reference identity index

Machine-readable exact identity index for workbook section `④`. One row per owner
App with its exact `AppName/Model` identities and the governing availability rule.
Do not duplicate the fallback prose above.

| Owner | Exact workbook model identities | Governing availability rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
