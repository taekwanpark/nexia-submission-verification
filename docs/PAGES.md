# Submission Proof Pages and Interaction Contract

This file owns the App's target user-visible navigation, page roles, and entry
points. A listed destination is not evidence that its implementation has
shipped; verify package routes and contributions before claiming current
behavior.

## 1. Navigation and entry contract

Navigation exposure and user-facing naming follow the
[Frontend shell doctrine](../../../docs/doctrine/04-BOUNDARIES.md#frontend-experience).

### 1.1 Visible App Menu

List only the exact ordered groups and clickable destinations rendered in the
App Menu. Do not include cards, tabs, record details, or one-off actions.

`Group` is one of the five shell-owned groups, in this order: `insights`,
`management`, `operations`, `master-data`, `settings`. The App Overview is the
only destination with no group. An App contributes only the groups it needs, but
it never invents a sixth one and never collapses a group into a single entry
page — `settings` is a group holding one destination per policy or
configuration Resource, not one page that links to them.

| Group | User-visible label | Route | Page role | Visibility condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | Overview | `/apps/submission-proof` | App overview | App installed and readable |

### 1.2 Contextual and external entry points

Record every non-menu destination and the concrete place that opens it. Use
only `Contextual/detail`, `Embedded`, or `Action/transient` for Exposure.

| User-visible page title | Route or surface | Exposure | Opens from | Page role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | |

### 1.3 Page kinds

Every App Menu destination is one of four page kinds. People Core is the
reference for the first three; do not invent a fifth kind.

| Kind | Contract | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overview | One per App. Four to eight `NxStatCard` figures that open the list they count, plus create actions. No table. | `/apps/people` |
| Insights | `NxInsightSurface`: filter, then summary cards, then chart, then a chrome-free `ResourceTable`. An aggregate is not a browsable collection, so omit toolbar/footer and link to the owning list instead. | `/apps/people/insights/movements` |
| Resource list / form / detail | The generated triad. The list is `NxPageFrame` + `WorkSurface` + `WorkSection layout="fullBleed"` + `ResourceTable`; create is its own `/new` route; record actions live in the row action menu. | `/apps/people/employment-categories` |
| Config form | Owns exactly one record and edits its field set; it does not browse a collection. Optional parent selector plus a link to that parent's list, then `NxSectionCard` sections of `NxFieldset` / `NxFormField`. | `/apps/quality/settings/policies` |

Each kind has one source. The Overview arrives with the App from
`nexia-apps:make-package-app`. The Resource triad is emitted by
`nexia-apps:make-package-resource`: generate it, then edit what it produced — do not
hand-write a list, form, or detail. A hand-rolled one silently drops what the
generator wires for free, and the omissions are the same every time: field-level
validation errors, the `/{id}/edit` route, and the work-surface labels that give
a work tab its human title. Insights and Config form destinations have no
generator; write those by hand, against the contracts above.

A `management` destination is not a fifth kind: it is a Resource list carrying a
task-oriented label, the way `/apps/people/onboarding` resolves to the
onboarding-case list.

Both figure-bearing kinds state the data's age (`asOf`), and carry a
period-over-period `delta` wherever a comparison exists — `direction` picks the
arrow, `tone` picks the colour, kept separate because a rising defect count is
`up` and `negative`. A card counting rows off a list endpoint has no previous
period, so it carries no delta rather than an invented one. Overview cards open
their list through an `href` that retains the current scope query parameters,
never a hand-rolled `<button>` wrapper.

Insights destinations hold the date range in the URL via
`useInsightFilterState`, and each one draws a chart: `NxLineChart` for a trend,
`NxBarChart` to compare categories, `NxDonutChart` for parts of one whole.
Record any destination that genuinely has no shape worth drawing, and why, in
the table below.

Compose from domain signals, not by copying another App (full decision table:
`docs/reference/APPS.md#developing-an-app` step 10). An attention band
(`NxOverviewBand variant="attention"`) only when this App has states a person
must clear — a `Failed`/`Blocked` status value, an `*_exception_reason`
column, a failed-line counter, an overdue check, or capacity vs actuals; band
headings only when cards span more than one of exceptions / scheduled work /
context; a `delta` only when the API answers the same figure for a prior
window. Record below which parts this App uses and the code signal that
justified each:

| Part | Used | Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attention band | — | — |
| Band headings | — | — |
| Deltas | — | — |
| Charts per Insights destination | — | — |

Choose between a list and a config form from the schema, not by taste:

- `foreignId('parent_id')->unique(...)`, or one row per tenant or Legal Entity,
  means a config form. A list would always show a single row.
- `unique([parent_id, rule_key, version])`, or `code` plus `version`, means a
  versioned registry, so it is a Resource list.

Two shapes are retired. A hub page that only lists links to other destinations
is replaced by registering those destinations in the App Menu directly — a
config form is not a hub, because it owns the record it edits. A composite
workbench that wraps a list to add state actions is replaced by the list plus
its row action menu; a parent that must be edited with its children uses the
Resource detail page with a child grid and a modal editor, as
`/apps/talent/compensation-changes/{id}` does.

A list screen never hosts a create form, and a settings or master-data
destination never renders another destination's data.

## 2. Surface contract

Describe the lists, task surfaces, inquiry and status pages, settings, and
one-off operations named above. Keep internal component names separate from
user-facing labels.

Menu selection and placement live in `nexia.json` → `navigation`. Generators add stable screen IDs; change their group, sort and icon there. Labels, routes and permissions remain in the corresponding screen declarations. Omitting a menu entry does not remove its authorized route.
