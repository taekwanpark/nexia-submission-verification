## Purpose

Repository rules for the `submission-proof` Nexia App Package.

## Host boundary

- Work only in this App repository. Do not copy, mount, edit or deploy Core,
  Sandbox, CLI or SDK source/runtime images. The platform operator owns them.
- Import PHP platform contracts from `nexia-cloud-os/sdk-laravel` and
  frontend contracts from `@nexia/sdk`. Do not import Core or another App.
- Preserve the Composer PSR-4 namespace and registered App identity. Use
  Resource References, public contracts and declared events for cross-App work.
- Use `nexia link` and `nexia dev` for the operator-managed Sandbox. Keep
  secrets and server code outside public/. Never request login tokens in chat.
- Keep required installation data in this App's initializer; sample data is
  separate. Do not run other Apps' seeders or edit their migrations.
- App Family and launcher order are review requests; central administrators
  approve the catalog presentation.
- Report missing SDK/platform capabilities through developer-support. Prepare
  sanitized reports for developer review before submission.

## Organization scope UI

- Put page-owned organization scope in the Route Surface `organizationScope`
  slot through the SDK `NxOrganizationTargetSelector`; it renders after the
  breadcrumb and before header actions, and is not an action. Do
  not repeat it in a ResourceTable toolbar or `meta.list_schema.filterable`
  flyout.
- Generated standard common-data profiles render no selector. A tenant-owned
  custom relation or Operating Unit page may declare one. The Route Surface
  explicitly chooses its supported axes and read permission; ownership,
  applicability, and permission scope are distinct. Never infer scope from
  columns.
- Default an ordinary list to `useOrganizationListScope` with its read
  permission. Custom relationship or multi-permission pages keep their own URL
  adapter; do not force those authorities into the shared hook.
- Keep status, type, date, and other record conditions as ResourceTable filters.
- Compose forms with public NxFormSection/NxFormField inputs and the shared
  draft binding. Use NxResourceFormLegalEntityField for an authorized create
  target or the stored owner's human label on edit. Keep read content as
  text/links/badges, not disabled inputs. RecordSurface owns read/create/edit
  modes; do not infer editing authority from the route or hide a mounted form.
  Do not add a frontend Information Schema or duplicate owner selectors.


## Safety

- Tenant data and execution remain isolated.
- Authentication does not grant authorization; protected operations are
  enforced in the backend.
- Async work restores the tenant and actor context it requires.
- Durable product state does not depend only on browser storage.

Draft implementation and follow-up revisions defer automated validation. When
the user requests testing, verification, finalization, a commit, a push, or a
pull request, run the smallest focused validation that can disprove the changed
risk once. Reuse successful evidence while its relevant scope is unchanged.
Do not commit, push, publish, or mutate external services without explicit user
authorization.

## Change delivery

Use a purpose-named work branch in each changed repository. Do not create
change commits on, or push directly to, `main` or `develop`. Deliver through a
PR/MR and describe related Core/SDK/App changes and their merge order. Creating
a PR/MR does not authorize merging it; merge requires explicit user approval.
Do not weaken branch protection. Core, SDK, and App developers follow the same
workflow; no developer-specific local policy file is required.
